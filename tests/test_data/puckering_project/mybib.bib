abstract = {We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the multidimensional free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body systems by means of coarse-grained non-Markovian dynamics in the space defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determi-nation of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution. M olecular dynamics (MD) and the Monte Carlo simulation method have had a very deep influence on the most diverse fields, from materials science to biology and from astrophysics to pharmacology. Yet, despite their success, these simulation methods suffer from limitations that reduce the scope of their applications. A severe constraint is the limited time scale that present-day computer technology and sampling algorithms explore. In particular, there are many circumstances where the free energy surface (FES) has several local minima separated by large barriers. Examples of these situations include conforma-tional changes in solution, protein folding, first-order phase transitions, and chemical reactions. In such circumstances a simulation started in one minimum will be able to move spon-taneously to the next minimum only under very favorable circumstances. A host of methods have been suggested to lift this restriction and explore the FES (1–13) or to characterize the transition state (14, 15). Here we propose a solution to this problem by combining the ideas of coarse-grained dynamics (16, 17) on the FES (10, 12) with those of adaptive bias potential methods (2, 11), obtaining a procedure that allows the system to escape from local minima in the FES and, at the same time, permits a quantitative determination of the FES as a byproduct of the integrated process. Methodology We shall assume here that there exists a finite number of relevant collective coordinates s i , i ϭ 1,n where n is a small number, and we consider the dependence of the free energy Ᏺ(s) on these parameters. Practical examples of appropriate choices of these variables will be given below. The exploration of the FES is guided by the forces F i t ϭ ϪѨᏲ͞Ѩs i t . To estimate these forces efficiently, we introduce an ensemble of P replicas of the system, each obeying the constraint that the collective coordinates have a preassigned value s i ϭ s i t , and each evolved independently at the same temperature T. Since the P replicas are statistically inde-pendent, the estimate of thermodynamic observables (e.g., the forces on the constraints) is improved with respect to an eval-uation on a single replica, and it can be parallelized in a straightforward manner. The constraints are imposed on each replica via the standard methods of constrained molecular dynamics (18) by adding to the Lagrangean a term ⌺ iϭ1,n ␭ i (s i Ϫs i t) where ␭ i are Lagrange multipliers. Averaging over the time and over the replicas we can evaluate the derivative of the free energy relative to s i t as F i t ϭ ͗␭ i ͘ (1, 4). For the sake of simplicity we neglect here the small kinematic correction term discussed in ref. 4, although this can be added easily. Taking a cue from the work of Kevrikidis et al. (16), we use these forces, determined by},

abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass can be utilized to produce ethanol, a promising alternative energy source for the limited crude oil. There are mainly two processes involved in the conversion: hydrolysis of cellulose in the lignocellulosic biomass to produce reducing sugars, and fermentation of the sugars to ethanol. The cost of ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials is relatively high based on current technologies, and the main challenges are the low yield and high cost of the hydrolysis process. Considerable research efforts have been made to improve the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to remove lignin and hemicellulose can significantly enhance the hydrolysis of cellulose. Optimization of the cellulase enzymes and the enzyme loading can also improve the hydrolysis. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation effectively removes glucose, which is an inhibitor to cellulase activity, thus increasing the yield and rate of cellulose hydrolysis.},

Here, by tessellating medium rings into triangular planes and using the relative angles made between triangular planes we are able to assign macrocyclic pucker conformations into canonical pucker conformers such as chairs, boats, etc. We show that the definition is straightforward compared with other methods popularly used for small rings and that it is computationally simple to implement for complex macrocyclic rings. These cyclic conformational coordinates directly couple to the motion of individual nodes of a ring. Therefore, they are useful for correlating the physical properties of macrocycles with their ring pucker and measuring the dynamic ring conformational behavior. We illustrate the triangular tessellation, assignment, and pucker analysis on 7- and 8-membered rings. Sets of canonical states are given for cycloheptane and cyclooctane that have been previously experimentally analysed.},

As argued here, a true path can only be defined for E[?]and ? for the same systems: By computing errors in E[?], it is shown that different functionals show remarkably linear error relationships between ? and E[?] on well-defined but different paths towards exactness, and the ranking in Science, 355, 6320, 2017, 49−52 breaks down. For example, M06-2X, said to perform poorly, performs very well on the E,? paths defined here, and local (non-GGA) functionals rapidly increase errors in E[?]due to the failure to describe dynamic correlation of compact systems without the gradient. Finally, a measure of "exactness" is given by the product of errors in E[?] and ?; these relationships may be more relevant focus points than a time line if one wants to estimate exactness and develop new exact functionals.

abstract = {Although several methods of quantitative conformational characterization exist in the literature, all these methods use a spherical polar coordinate representation which is in contrast to the qualitative description based on the IUPAC nomenclature. To bridge this gap this paper introduces a method to characterize six-membered ring conformations as a linear combination of ideal basic conformations. The linear combination coefficients are derived by projection of the vector of torsion angles onto those of ideal basic conformations. As the IUPAC nomenclature uses subscripts and superscripts to indicate atoms below and above the reference plane, the linear combination coefficients combined with the IUPAC name provide an instant visual image of the conformation. The method introduced here is based on endocyclic dihedral angles and requires only three dihedral angles for a full characterization, which is often available by NMR measurements for rigid conformations. We provide a table of equations to determine the missing dihedral angles based on redundancy conditions. The relationship between linear combinations and spherical representation similar to the well-known Cremer-Pople parameters is presented. In deriving the spherical conformational parameters we solved an inconsistency of previous definitions for spherical representation, namely that none of previous definitions place the intermediate halfchair or twistboat conformations exactly halfway between the pole (chair) and the equator (boat and twistboat) of the sphere as expected based on intuitive stereochemistry. To make our method generally available we provide an interface on the Internet that carries out all calculations described in the paper and allows the user to visualize, rotate and manipulate the ring (http://www.nrc.ca/ibs/6ring.html). By simplifying both the concepts and the access to carry out the calculations more experimental chemists can benefit from the description of ring conformation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A unique mean plane is defined for a general monocyclic puckered ring. The geometry of the puckering relative to this plane is described by amplitude and phase coordinates which are generalizations of those introduced for cyclopentane by Kilpatrick, Pitzer, and Spitzer. Unlike earlier treatments based on torsion angles, no mathematical approximations are involved. A short treatment of the four-, five-, and six-membered ring demonstrates the usefulness oexample is given of the analysis of crystallographic structural data in terms of these coordinates.},

@article{Mayes2014,
abstract = {Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) distort carbohydrate ring geometry along particular "catalytic itineraries" during the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, illustrating the relationship between substrate conformation and reactivity. Previous theoretical studies of thermodynamics of isolated monosaccharides offer insights into the catalytic itineraries of particular sugars. However, kinetic accessibility of carbohydrate puckering conformations and the role of exocyclic groups have not yet been thoroughly addressed. Here we present the first complete library of low-energy local minima and puckering interconversion transition states for five biologically relevant pyranose sugars: $\beta$-xylose, $\beta$-mannose, $\alpha$-glucose, $\beta$-glucose, and $\beta$-N-acetylglucosamine. These were obtained by a thorough theoretical investigation each of the 38 IUPAC designated puckering geometries and all possible conformations of the exocyclic groups. These calculations demonstrate that exocyclic groups must be explicitly considered when examining these interconversion pathways. Furthermore, these data enable evaluation of previous hypotheses of why enzymes perturb ring geometries from the low-energy equatorial chair ((4)C1) conformation. They show that the relative thermodynamics alone do not universally correlate with GH catalytic itineraries. For some sugars, particular puckers offer both catalytically favorable electronic structure properties, such as anomeric carbon partial charge, and low kinetic barriers to achieve a given puckering conformation. However, different factors correlate with catalytic itineraries for other sugars; for $\beta$-N-acetylglucosamine, the key N-acetyl arm confounds the puckering landscape and appears to be the crucial factor. Overall, this study reveals a more comprehensive understanding of why particular puckering geometries are favored in carbohydrate catalysis concomitant with the complexity of glycobiology.},

@article{Barnett2010,
abstract = {The puckered conformations of furanose and pyranose carbohydrate rings are central to analyzing the action of enzymes on carbohydrates. Enzyme reaction mechanisms are generally inaccessible to experiments and so have become the focus of QM(semiempirical)/MM simulations. We show that the complete free energy of puckering is required to evaluate the accuracy of semiempirical methods used to study reactions involving carbohydrates. Interestingly, we find that reducing the free energy space to lower dimensions results in near meaningless minimum energy pathways. We analyze the furanose and pyranose free energy pucker surfaces and volumes using AM1, PM3, PM3CARB-1, and SCC-DFTB. A comparison with DFT optimized structures and a HF free energy surface reveals that SCC-DFTB provides the best semiempirical description of five- and six-membered carbohydrate ring deformation.},
